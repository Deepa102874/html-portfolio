<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am Deepa, a dedicated and detail-oriented technology professional with over 4 years 
of experience in software quality assurance and a strong foundation in Java development. My journey began
in manual and automation testing, where I worked extensively with Selenium, TestNG, Postman, and JIRA to validate web and mobile applications. Over time, I developed a deep interest in backend logic,
software design, and Java-based development.Currently, I am transitioning into a Java Developer role,
leveraging my existing technical strengths to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications.
I am proficient in Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, and relational databases like MySQL, and have hands-on experience with CI/CD tools like Maven, Jenkins, and Git.


<p>
  I hold a Master's degree in Information Systems from Indiana Institute of Technology and a Bachelor's in Computer Applications
  from Rani Channamma University. I'm currently working in the U.S. under OPT and am eligible for STEM OPT extension. 
  Iâ€™m passionate about software quality, continuous learning, and contributing to agile development environments.

  My strengths include clear communication, strong analytical thinking, and a commitment to improving product quality 
  through effective testing strategies. I strive to ensure every application I work on delivers a seamless user experience,
  and I enjoy exploring new tools and methodologies in the QA and software testing space.
